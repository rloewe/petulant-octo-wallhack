======================
This project is nothing serious and will propably never be.
It's a loose idea about an insane programming language which we'll try to implement some day.

## Name ideas
- An programminglanguage
- Pow

## Implementation ideas
- Improbable numbers
    - An example could be that division by zero will give an improbable number
- Magical numbers
    - Numbers that change form and base at any time
    - Magical numbers are a subset of improbable numbers
- Possibility to calculate with infinite
    - infinite + 1 should be a working case as should infinite - 1
- Maybe type
    - not in the Haskell/SML sense, but a computation that might happen, and might not. True/false/maybe
- Define scoping type
    - on each function/method/watevah you can define what type of scoping you want (ie. either static or dynamic)
- ☃ operator which holds the last used lambda expression

- dynamic types

## Syntax ideas
- Possibly Lisp syntax
- Not be indentation based
- MIPS like array indexing, like this: 5(array) for the sixth element
- New ternaries, other than "if then else", for loop, either
- if we want pointers, then these could be used: ☞ or ☛
- True and false symbol ideas:
    - ⊤ (true) and ⊥ (false)
    - true and false (plain text)
    - 👍 (true) and 👎 (false)
- loop symbol ideas:
    -  ⃙
    - ⥁
    - ⟳
    - 🔁 and 🔃
- Null = �?
- To cast an exception you could use ⚐ (a white flag, it is just like saying I give up)
- I can not find a use for these, but they are perfect:
