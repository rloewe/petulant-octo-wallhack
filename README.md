======================
This project is nothing serious and will propably never be.
It's a loose idea about an insane programming language which we'll try to implement some day.

## Name ideas
- An programminglanguage

## Implementation ideas
- Improbable numbers
    - An example could be that division by zero will give an improbable number
- Magical numbers
    - Numbers that change form and base at any time
    - Magical numbers are a subset of improbable numbers
- Possibility to calculate with infinite
    - infinite + 1 should be a working case as should infinite - 1
- Maybe type
    - not in the Haskell/SML sense, but a computation that might happen, and might not. True/false/maybe
